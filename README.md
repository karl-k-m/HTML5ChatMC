# HTML5ChatMC
A Paper plugin for piping HTML5Chat messages into Minecraft chat.  

# Commands:
**/html5toggle** - Turn the chat piping on (serverwide).  
**/html5** - Display/hide the HTML5-Chat (player-based).

# Important:
For changing which channel (room ID) you wish to view, change the roomId variable value in *java/com/github/karlkm/services/MessageServeService.java* on line 26 before you build. I'll eventually implement a config file but I'm currently too lazy.
